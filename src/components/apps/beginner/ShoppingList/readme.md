# Project 3: Shopping List App

This is the created fifth in the list. Funcitonality wise we can `add item` to list, `stike off` if we have purchased the item, `delete item` from the list, `update existing items` in the list. 

Used Concept of `useState` to build the app. Converted the app to make use of `useReducer` hook that is an intermediate concept. Ultimately made use of `useContext` hook for creating scalable apps.

In this project we can add items to our shopping list.
