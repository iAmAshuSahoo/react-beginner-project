Browser JS Engine
It knows document, createElement, appendChild. But it donot know React

For this we add React.
1. For this we can use CDN links - Links where the code is hoisted.

CDN is Content Delivery Network

Problem Solving - when someone is making a purchase and they are sitting at a geologically different place. It leads them to face delay due to time taken by packets and bad user experience. Here CDN helps. Cloudflare is a company. CDN helps in hoisting huge content near customer.

HW1 -
CDN is not a replacement to web hoisting. CDN help in imporving performance. It depends on sixe and need of internet.
1. Improving website load times
2. Reducing bandwith costs
3. Increase content availability and redundancy.
4. Improving wensite security - DDoS Attack  -  When site becomes popular, hacker try to block system by doing a distributed attack such that they create bot army from many available machines to use your resources. Thus resulting in network error. Here the Cloudflare CDN helps in distributing the false request protecting customers interests.

**Be Curious about everything** - Dive deep into every small thing.
HW2-
We use 2 CDN script tags we injected the whole react code and react dom code into our application.

2 types of devs
1. One Who build react
2. Second, us who use this.

## React
Most costly operation in a browser is to introduce interactivity.
React solves this problem for us.

We use the createElement, createRoot

It takes in 3 parameter element, attribute in the form of objects and props. Then createElement returns object.

If we code like this things become hard for us, so we use JSX.
