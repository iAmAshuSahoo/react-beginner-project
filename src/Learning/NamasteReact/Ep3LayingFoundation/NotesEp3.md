# scripts in package json.
1. We run the code with command *npx parcel .\index.html*.
2. To make it easy we can define the scripts to run. *"start": "parcel index.html",* 
3. We can use npm start or npm run start to run the project. This is same as calling *npx parcel .\index.html*
4. npm build will not work. we have to write npm run build. This only works for start.
